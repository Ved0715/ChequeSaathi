## 6. RISK SCORING SYSTEM

### Calculation Formula

```typescript
// Calculated dynamically when viewing customer
const totalCheques = await prisma.cheque.count({
  where: { customerId, deletedAt: null }
});

const bouncedCheques = await prisma.cheque.count({
  where: {
    customerId,
    status: 'BOUNCED',
    deletedAt: null
  }
});

const riskScore = totalCheques > 0
  ? Math.round((bouncedCheques / totalCheques) * 100)
  : 0;

// Risk score = (bounced cheques / total cheques) √ó 100
```

### Risk Categories

**Low Risk (0-20%)** - üü¢ Green
- Reliable customer
- Accept cheques confidently
- Example: 1 bounced out of 10 = 10%

**Medium Risk (21-50%)** - üü° Yellow
- Be cautious
- Consider asking for advance or smaller amounts
- Example: 3 bounced out of 10 = 30%

**High Risk (51-100%)** - üî¥ Red
- Avoid accepting cheques
- Request cash/NEFT/UPI only
- Example: 6 bounced out of 10 = 60%

### Risk Score Updates

**Automatically recalculated when:**
- New cheque added
- Cheque status changes to BOUNCED
- Cheque status changes to CLEARED
- Cheque is soft-deleted

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. Soft Delete vs Hard Delete
**Decision: Soft Delete**
- Financial records must be kept for compliance
- Audit trail requirement
- Data recovery possibility
- Mark deletedAt instead of removing

### 2. Static Fields vs Dynamic Calculation
**Decision: Dynamic Calculation**
- Single source of truth (cheques table)
- No sync issues
- Always accurate
- Calculate totalCheques, bouncedCheques on demand

### 3. httpOnly Cookies vs localStorage
**Decision: httpOnly Cookies**
- XSS attack protection
- Automatic sending with requests
- Industry standard for web apps
- More secure for financial data

### 4. Monolithic vs Separate Frontend/Backend
**Decision: Separate**
- Can add mobile app later
- Backend serves multiple clients
- Better security separation
- Independent scaling

### 5. Image Storage
**Decision: Cloudinary (not database or local storage)**
- Automatic optimization
- CDN delivery (fast worldwide)
- Thumbnail generation
- No server storage management
- Scalable

---

## Status Transition Rules

### Valid Transitions:
```
RECEIVED ‚Üí DEPOSITED ‚úÖ
DEPOSITED ‚Üí CLEARED ‚úÖ
DEPOSITED ‚Üí BOUNCED ‚úÖ
```

### Invalid Transitions (Prevented by Backend):
```
DEPOSITED ‚Üí RECEIVED ‚ùå
CLEARED ‚Üí DEPOSITED ‚ùå
BOUNCED ‚Üí CLEARED ‚ùå
BOUNCED ‚Üí DEPOSITED ‚ùå
Any status ‚Üí RECEIVED ‚ùå (can only be initial status)
```

### Why Prevent Backward Transitions?
1. **Audit Integrity:** Financial records shouldn't be altered
2. **Fraud Prevention:** Staff can't mark bounced as cleared
3. **Compliance:** Regulatory requirements
4. **Data Trust:** History remains accurate
